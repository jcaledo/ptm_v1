\title{Compute Cross Product}
\usage{
xprod(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{vectors involved in the cross product.}
}
\value{
This function returns a vector that is orthogonal to the plane containing the two vector used as arguments.
}
\description{
Computes the  cross product of two vectors in three-dimensional euclidean space.
}
\details{
For each methionyl residue taking place in a S-aromatic motif, this function cumputes the aromatic residue involved, the distance between the delta sulfur and the aromatic ring's centroid, as well as the angle between the sulfur-aromatic vector and the normal vector of the plane containing the aromatic ring.
