\title{Search for S-Aromatic Motifs}
\usage{
saro.motif(pdb, threshold = 7, onlySaro = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{pdb}{either the path to the PDB file of interest or the 4-letters identifier.}

\item{threshold}{distance in ångströms, between the S atom and the aromatic ring centroid, used as threshold.}

\item{onlySaro}{logical, if FALSE the output includes information about Met residues that are not involved in S-aromatic motifs.}
}
\value{
The function returns a dataframe reporting the S-aromatic motifs found for the protein of interest.
}
\description{
Searches for S-aromatic motifs in proteins.
}
\details{
For each methionyl residue taking place in a S-aromatic motif, this function computes the aromatic residues involved, the distance between the delta sulfur and the aromatic ring's centroid, as well as the angle between the sulfur-aromatic vector and the normal vector of the plane containing the aromatic ring.
