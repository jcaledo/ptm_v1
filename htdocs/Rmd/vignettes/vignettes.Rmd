In addition to the standard CRAN documentation of the _ptm_ functions, we also distribute a number of extended vignettes that provide worked examples of using _ptm_ to perform a particular task. Currently available vignettes include:

* [S-Aromatic Motifs and Calmodulin](./S-Aromatic-Motifs-and-Calmodulin)
* [Exploring MetO Sequence Environments](./Exploring-MetO-Sequence-Environments)
* [Building Up a Dataset for the Study of Phosphoserines](./Building-Up-a-Dataset-for-the-Study-of-Phosphoserines)
* [Building Up a Dataset for 3D Analyses of MetO Sites](./Building-Up-a-Dataset-for-3D-Analyses-of-MetO Sites)
