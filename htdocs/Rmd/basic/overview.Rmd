## Overview

_ptm_ is an R package containing utilities for the analysis of post-translational modifications (PTMs) in proteins, with particular emphasis on the [sulfoxidation of methionine ](https://metosite.uma.es/blog/methionine-proteins) residues. 

It is currently distributed as platform independent source code under the [GPL version 2 license](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html). Please, see the [Installing ](./installing) _ptm_ page for installation instructions. 

## Features
  
* Straigthforward way to download, filter and analyze data from the sulfoxidation database [_MetOSite_](https://metosite.uma.es).
* Integration of major protein PTM and sequence databases and associated search tools.
* Data visualization: by using visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps, data visualization tools provide an accessible way to see and understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data related to PTM. 
* In addition, various utility functions are provided to enable the statistical and graphical power of the R environment to work with biological sequence and structural data.

## Development

For information on current and future development of _ptm_, see the ptm project on [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/jcaledo/ptm/src/master/).
