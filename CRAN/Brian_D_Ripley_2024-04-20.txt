Dear maintainer,

Please see the problems shown on
<https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_ptm.html>.

Please correct before 2024-05-04 to safely retain your package on CRAN.

Packages in Suggests should be used conditionally: see 'Writing R Extensions'.
This needs to be corrected even if the missing package(s) become available.
It can be tested by checking with _R_CHECK_DEPENDS_ONLY_=true.

The CRAN Team
